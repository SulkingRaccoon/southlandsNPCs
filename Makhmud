Makhmud – Level 3 Prejudiced Fighter (Battle Master)
	Makhmud, a son of the Autumn tribe, showed finesse and courage at a young age.  At thirteen, he enlisted in a small raiding group, and was readily accepted, in no small part because of his family’s affluence.  Not quite two years into his short militrary career, Makhmud was acting as an overnight sentry in a routine exercise.  Three strangers, who he would eventually come to know as Xin, quietly approached Makhmud.  One man explained their plight – they were refugees from the north, escaping wrongful persecution, seeking safe passage.  Oblivious, Makhmud let them through and reported an uneventful night to his superiors.
	Some weeks later, the troop was met with unfortunate news.  A nearby ruin, one that had previously been a secret to foreigners, was ransacked.  The plunderers, three Xin men, were caught but the precious artifacts they stole were never recovered.  Tho others passed off the event as an unfortunate mishap, Makhmud remembered the three travelers he met when he was watching over the camp.  Overwhelmed with guilt and burdened with secrets, he left the army and returned to the safety of his parents, where he could live quietly.
	Gradually, his guilt gave way to resentment of the three thieves, then to disgust of all things Xin.  Seeking to mend the mistake made in his childhood, he traveled to the Summer tribe where, in his eyes, the Xin menace was thriving.  The young khan Ruslan admired the youth’s ability and zeal, and appointed Makhmud to protect the ruins from invaders and looters.  Makhmud happily accepted the title, and now leads a small group of guardians in his crusade against the Xin.
